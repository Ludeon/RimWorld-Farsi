## 🤝 Contribution

The Farsi translation is a community-driven project powered by passionate RimWorld fans. Want to improve the translation or fix a bug? We'd love for you to contribute and make the Persian experience even better!

### **RTL Language Support**
Since Farsi and Arabic languages utilize RTL (Right-to-Left) scripts, we've developed a specialized tool: `rimworld-rtl-translation-tools-PersianModded`. This ensures proper text display within the game by adapting the language layout.

💡 *Note:* You’ll need **Ruby** installed to run the conversion tool.
