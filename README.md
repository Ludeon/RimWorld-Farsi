# RimWorld Farsi Translation

Welcome to the Farsi translation repository for RimWorld!

توضیحات فارسی 🇮🇷 [ریدمی فارسی](https://github.com/Ludeon/RimWorld-Farsi/blob/master/README_fa.md)


## Installation Instructions
To add the Farsi language to your game:
1. Download the `persian.language.zip` file from the **Releases** section.
2. Extract the contents.
3. Copy the extracted folder to the following directory:  
   `<RimWorld Installation Path>\Data\`


## Contribution
These translations are a collaborative effort by the RimWorld community. If you're a fan and wish to enhance the Farsi translation, your contributions are welcome!

### Translation Conversion Tool
The game engines often do not support RTL languages like Farsi and Arabic natively. To address this, we use a conversion tool that adapts the text for proper in-game display. The `rimworld-rtl-translation-tools-PersianModded` is a variant of this tool, specifically altered to support the Persian alphabet.

To test source code and build fixed RTL text for the game, utilize the `rimworld-rtl-translation-tools-PersianModded`. Just so you know, running this tool requires Ruby.
