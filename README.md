All these translations are made by fans of the game. You can participate in these translations to improve the translation.

### Why is this tool used for translation conversion?
Because game engines natively do not support Farsi and Arabic languages and RTL languages in general, we had to use the tool in the link at the bottom of the page to change it for proper display, and in the Persian folder.
Because the Arabic and Persian alphabets are different, I changed the tool based on the Persian alphabet.

### How to add this language? 

Download and extract the Persian zip file available in the Released section and copy it to the address below.
