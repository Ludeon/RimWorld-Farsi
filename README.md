### What is the difference between Persian and PersianModded?
Because game engines natively do not support Farsi and Arabic languages and RTL languages in general, we had to use the tool in the link at the bottom of the page to change it for proper display, and in the Persian folder, the Farsi translation. It is placed in the PersianModded folder, and Persian translation has been done using the tool. To cooperate with us in the project, you must translate the `Persian` folder, and if you want to apply the translation output in the game, you must put the `PersianModded` folder in the game.


### How to add this language? 

Copy the files inside PersianModded to the address below.
game installation folder`\Data\`
