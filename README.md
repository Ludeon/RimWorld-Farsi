# RimWorld Farsi Translation

This project is the official Farsi language pack for RimWorld, created by Ludeon Studio, with translations contributed free of charge by the community.

Because the in-game version may not always be up-to-date, players can download and install the latest translation from this repository.

## üöÄ **Installation Instructions**

Follow these steps to add the Persian language to your RimWorld adventure:

### **A. Automated Method in Windows (Recommended)**

1.  Copy the `AutoFaInstall.bat` file to your main game folder.
2.  Run the file to automatically download and install the latest translation.

### **B. Standard Method**

1.  Download the latest translation from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Ludeon/RimWorld-Farsi/releases).
2.  Replace the language folders for your game version in the following paths:

    *   **Core:** Copy the contents of the `Core` folder from the zip file to `<Your RimWorld Path>\Data\Core\Languages\` and rename it to `Persian`.
    *   **Royalty:** Copy the contents of the `Royalty` folder to `<Your RimWorld Path>\Data\Royalty\Languages\` and rename it to `Persian`.
    *   **Ideology:** Copy the contents of the `Ideology` folder to `<Your RimWorld Path>\Data\Ideology\Languages\` and rename it to `Persian`.
    *   **Biotech:** Copy the contents of the `Biotech` folder to `<Your RimWorld Path>\Data\Biotech\Languages\` and rename it to `Persian`.
    *   **Anomaly:** Copy the contents of the `Anomaly` folder to `<Your RimWorld Path>\Data\Anomaly\Languages\` and rename it to `Persian`.

    **Note:** If folders with the same name already exist, delete them before copying the new ones.

    *   The `Core` folder should contain four folders (`Backstories`, `DefInjected`, `Keyed`, `Strings`) and two files (`LangIcon.png`, `LanguageInfo.xml`). Ensuring this structure is correct will prevent errors.

#### **Game Installation Paths for Different Operating Systems:**

*   **Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\RimWorld\`
*   **Linux:** `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Rimworld`
*   **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldMac.app` (Right-click and select "Show Package Contents" to access).



### **C. Advanced Method (for Developers)**

If you have cloned this repository to your computer, you can use **Symbolic Links** to automatically keep your local translation files in sync with the latest changes.

To create a symbolic link in Windows, you can use the `mklink /D "Target Path" "Source Path"` command in the Command Prompt (in Administrator mode).

### **How to Translate**

The translation files in this project are in XML format. To edit them, it is recommended to use a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The structure of a text to be translated is as follows:

```xml
<!-- EN: English text to be translated -->
<SomeTag>TODO</SomeTag><!-- optional_comment -->
```

*   `<!-- EN: ... -->`: This section contains the original English text and should not be changed.
*   `TODO`: You should replace `TODO` with the Farsi translation.
*   `<!-- optional_comment -->`: These comments may contain useful information.

### **RTL (Right-to-Left) Conversion Tool**

To ensure proper display of Persian text, Python-based tools are used. To contribute to the translation and build the final files, you need to fork this repository and run the Persian text correction workflow in your fork.
