# Farsi Translation for RimWorld

## Licensing

2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Transfer the extracted files to the `Data` directory located in your RimWorld installation folder.


## Contribution

We believe in the power of community and welcome contributions from all quarters. If you wish to enhance the quality of the Farsi translation, your participation would be highly appreciated.

### The Need for a Translation Conversion Tool

Native support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages such as Farsi and Arabic is not a standard feature in many game engines. To ensure the correct rendering and display of these languages in-game, we employ a conversion tool. This tool, linked at the end of this page, has been specifically modified to cater to the unique characteristics of the Persian alphabet, distinct from Arabic.


### Tools Utilized

The **rimworld-rtl-translation-tools-PersianModded** tool is employed for the translation conversion process.
